Installation and Usage
I've also created a detailed installation guide that explains how to:

Install the plugin in your Redmine instance
Configure and use its features
Troubleshoot common issues
Uninstall if needed

To install the plugin, follow the instructions in the installation guide. Once installed, administrators will see a "User Activity Report" link in the top menu of Redmine.
